It can be useful for Windows docker to substitute configuration files with the environment variables during bootstrap.

envsubst.exe <file>
```

```
$ cat example.txt
Hello %WORLD%!

# If environment variable is undefined, leave it as is. The result is echoed back.
$ mono download/envsubst.exe example.txt
Hello %WORLD%!

# Define environment variable this time and try again
$ export WORLD=World
$ mono download/envsubst.exe example.txt
Hello World!

Hello World!
```
